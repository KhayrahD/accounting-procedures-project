Gracefully handles invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric inputs).
Displays the result of the selected operation clearly to the user.
Implements a loop that allows the user to perform multiple calculations until choosing to exit.
Organized codes into functions to encapsulate specific operations.
Maintained a clear separation between function definitions and the main program.
Include error handling for different scenarios.
Provides an option for users to exit the program.
